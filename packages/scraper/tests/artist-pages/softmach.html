<b>Summary</b><br>
The Canterbury school of British progressive-rock (one of the most significant
movements in the history of rock music) was born in 1962 when
Hugh Hopper, Robert Wyatt, Kevin Ayers, Richard Sinclair and others
formed the Wilde Flowers.
Wyatt, Ayers, Hopper and their new friends Daevid Allen and
Mike Ratledge formed the
Soft Machine (1966), whereas Sinclair and the others went on to form Caravan. 
Soft Machine, one of the greatest
rock bands of all time, started out with albums such as <b>Volume Two</b> (1969)
that were inspired by psychedelic-rock with a touch of Dadaistic
(i.e., nonsensical) aesthetics; but, after losing Allen and Ayers, they
veered towards a personal interpretation
of Miles Davis' jazz-rock on <b>Three</b> (1970), their masterpiece and one of the essential jazz, rock and classical albums of the 1970s.
Minimalistic keyboards a` la Terry Riley and jazz horns highlight three of
the four jams (particularly, Hopper's <i>Facelift</i>). The other one,
<i>The Moon In June</i>, is Wyatt's first monumental achievement, blending a
delicate melody, a melancholy atmosphere and deep humanity.
<i>The Moon In June</i> will remain in the essential canon of music well after
rock music has disappeared.
A vastly revised line-up,
 heavily influenced by Ian Carr's and
Keith Tippett's jazz ensembles,
that in october 1969 added a four-piece jazz horn section (notably Elton Dean),
continued the experiment in a colder, brainy, austere manner,
for example with the 
four-movement suite <i>Virtually</i> (1971), on their fourth album,
and the futuristic <i>1983</i> (1972), on their sixth album.

<A HREF=../vol3/ayers.html>Kevin Ayers</A>,
<A HREF=../vol2/allen.html>Daevid Allen</A> and

influential and creative solo careers in the entire history of rock music.


<hr>
<b>Full bio</b>.<br>
(Translated from the Italian by Troy Sherman)<P>

<p class=MsoNormal>The legend of the Canterbury scene began in a cellar. <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol3/wyatt.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Robert Wyatt</span></a>, born in 1945 in
Bristol, emigrated to Dulwich (a suburb of London) and settled down in 1956 in
Canterbury. At the beginning of the 1960s, he spent his days attending the
local &quot;Simon Langston School,&quot; while his evenings were spent with
classmates Pye Hastings and Richard Coughlan; with them, he played music in the
basement of his house. Born from these basement jams were the Wilde Flowers, an
amateur group whose sound reflected the leader’s passion for rhythm and blues
and jazz.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The Wilde Flower’s lineup would stabilize in 1962 with Wyatt
on drums, brothers Brian and <a href="http://scaruffi.com/vol3/hopper.html"><span
style='mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Hugh Hopper</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> and Richard Sinclair. Meanwhile,
<a href="http://scaruffi.com/vol2/allen.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Daevid Allen</span></a> (born 1938),
already a poet and playwright in Melbourne, arrived in England from Australia.
He was an art student that wandered aimlessly for a year around the country<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span> He was fresh with Parisian
experience as well; he had played jazz and composed music for William Burroughs
in France<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span> He found a room
to rent with Wyatt and his “Canterbury College of Art” roommate <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol3/ayers.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Kevin Ayers</span></a>. Misled by the
experienced and astute Allen, still teenaged Robert Wyatt decided to follow him
on one of his episodes in Paris, leaving the Wilde Flowers in the hands of
Ayers.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>1963 dates at the “Marquee” by the Daevid Allen Trio (which
was comprised of Allen, Hopper, and Wyatt) would eventually surface on <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Live </b>(Voiceprint, 1993).<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The members of the Wilde Flowers at this point were: Ayers,
Sinclair (bass), his cousin David (keyboards), Hastings (guitar) and Coughlan
(drums). Ayers, born in 1944 in a small village around the area, had grown up
in Malaysia, and at sixteen years of age returned to his native Kent, England.<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Meanwhile in Paris, Wyatt and Allen were haunting the
underground expatriated beatniks. The enterprising Allen, during this time,
organized multi-media performances, played piano in bars with <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/oldavant/riley.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Terry Riley</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> performed with jazz big bands,
and eventually fell in love with a poet and journalist named Gilly Smith. It
was not long before they reached Hugh Hopper in France. When the three
Parisians did return, they were readmitted into the Wilde Flowers, bringing to
the band a refined, intellectual style of improvisation and dada-rock. Allen in
1964 also published his first book of poems.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Wilde Flowers</b>
(Voiceprint, 1993) would collect recordings of this group (compositions mainly
by the two Hoppers).</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>In 1965 Ayers migrated to Oxford, where he attended school<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span> Mike Ratledge, at the time, was
his classmate there. Ayers would eventually be what divided the group: on one
side was Soft Machine (their name derived from the title of a book by
Burroughs), with Ratledge (keyboards), Wyatt (drums), Allen (guitar), and Ayers
(bass). The other was <a href="http://scaruffi.com/vol2/caravan.html"><span
style='mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Caravan</span></a>,
comprised of Hastings, Sinclair and Coughlan.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Soft Machine began quietly, with a formation that resembled
that of <a href="http://scaruffi.com/vol2/nice.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Nice</span></a>. In 1966, they came into
the UFO Club in London, together with Syd Barrett’s <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol2/pinkfloy.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Pink Floyd</span></a>. In this place
they discovered the then unknown American record producer Kim Fowley<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span> He introduced the band to the
music industry and (in February 1967) produced their first 45 rpm single:
Feelin' Reelin' Squeelin'/ Love Makes Sweet Music (which, incidentally, was
recorded in the same studio that Jimi Hendrix was training with his rhythm
guitar).</p>


<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Jet Propelled
Photographs</b> (Charly, 1989) is a 1967 recording by the original line-up of
Allen, Ratledge, Wyatt and Ayers.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The quartet would soon find themselves in France, where they
gained some success with audiences and critics.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>After their stay in France, their return to England was
disappointing: Daevid Allen had no valid passport<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span>
and was forced to remain in France. There, he gave life to <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol2/allen.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Gong</span></a>. The three survivors
(fresh from the triumph of their aforementioned first single) were brought into
the presence of Jimi Hendrix through mutual management<span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>.</span> They would end up following him, opening for his
American tour dates in 1968.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>With the help of producer Tom Wilson (who had also worked
with <a href="http://scaruffi.com/vol1/dylan.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Bob Dylan</span></a> and the <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol1/byrds.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Byrds</span></a>), Soft Machine recorded
their first album, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Soft Machine </b>(Probe,
1968), on foreign American soil. Without the presence of Allen, Ayers is the
dominant force while Wyatt remains timid. The songs obviously have influence
from the Beat Generation, but also draw from psychedelia, the Orient, rosewater
jazz, and<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> underneath the
surface, there transpires an earnest irony that owes something to Dada in
Paris. This album, in reality, is the embryo of the looming revolutionary
music: in it lies the geometrical keyboard lines of Ratledge; the quiet, high
register singing of Wyatt; Ayers’ Jazz; psychedelic counterpoints; goggled
chants; a forest of endless and percussive drum solos; and intoxicating parts
of cocktail style. The first side of the record, which is much more unified,
contains two suites: The first is the jazz-psychedelic<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> Hope for Happiness</i>, where Wyatt sings a mantra above a
sarabande-driven electric organ. This opening track contains fast passages with
changes in pace on the drums performed as if by extraterrestrials. Ayers fits
in a long bass solo reminiscent of Hendrix’s <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Third Stone from the Sun. </i>The second of side one’s suites is the
classical <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>So Boot If At All</i>. This
track is pointillist, given to free improvisation. Ratledge takes the role of
dissonance while Wyatt runs away in a sparkling solo. Already in this first
album, they are proving to be one of the most brilliant duets and creative
musical improvisers of all time. The song ends in a final hallucinogenic
thrill. Side two of the record, which is more fragmented than the first,
consists of mostly instrumental songs that take their melodies from the Beats,
soul music, and exotic folk; however, they always degenerate into impromptu
parties where the trio unleashes their joyful and caustic fantasies. In the
second side, Ratledge plays openly, and Wyatt goes wild on drumming sprees,
unleashing various levels of speed, acrobatics, and variety. Never before had a
drummer changed and mangled rhythms to such an insane extent. This facade is
still conceived as a single continuum, where the songs of Ayers (the memorable <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>We Did It Again</i>, the lyric of which is
the title repeated ad infinitum, and the psychedelic <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Why Are We Sleeping</i>, which is spoken by Ayers with an alternating
mystic chorus) serve as a return to organic music<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Before the release of the album at the very end of 1968, the
members of Soft Machine had time to relax. Ayers deserted to Mallorca with
Allen, Ratledge got homesick and headed for England, and Wyatt became
fascinated by America’s West-coast. When they recovered, they had switched bass
players from Ayers over to Hugh Hopper.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The second album, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Volume
Two </b>(Probe, 1969), is the prerogative of the two surviving founding
members. Wyatt’s touch on this album is pataphysical and impalpable. Ratledge
brings to the table a pleasant collage of tricks and imitations. As of 1969,
they had forgotten the Beats and Psychedelia in the name of rock, and began
preparing for their great leap into the 1970s. As with the first record, this
one was created with some artistic immaturity. There is an almost goliardic
insipidity, which acts as a warning against taking the creators too seriously.
In this record, Wyatt proves that he is still built on the style of the long
melodic fantasy (such as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Concise
British Alphabet Part 2</i>, which is his first practice in melancholy nonsense)<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span> The refrains of the melodies are
separated by instrumental sections, which are more or less improvised. The
record seems to be influenced more by Zappa than by Dadaism, which can be seen
on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pataphysical Introduction</i>, and
especially on the shooting festival of Hopper’s winds, side one’s finale, the
hallucinogenic <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Out Of Tunes</i>. Side two
is owned by a score of Ratledge’s ideas: the realistic special effects <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>of Fire Engine Passing With Bells</i>, the
first hints of their forthcoming excited instrumental jams (<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Hibou</i><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> Anemone and Bear</i>)<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> and the first applications of
the minimalism of Terry Riley (the alto sax and organ of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Orange Skin Food</i> and the solo organ and bass on <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>A Door Opens And Closes</i>). On this second
record, the great variety of solo and collective improvisations already places
Soft Machine in the Olympus of the rock world, even if they themselves had not
at that point come to know it.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class=MsoNormal>In 1970, with Allen and Ayers roaming in their own musical
endeavors, Wyatt and Ratledge were still struggling with Soft Machine: the
promising sound of the first two discs had not yet earned them money or fame.
Even so, the live performances from this era, with a cast of six or seven
performers each, were beginning to attract both public and critical attention.
Despite the lack of recorded credibility, Soft Machine were granted the
opportunity to record a double album. This album would be a document of the
great creative period of the three core members, assisted, as on tour since
October of 1969, by saxophonist Elton Dean, clarinetist Jimmy Hastings, and
trombonist Nick Evans, who were all members of <a
href="http://scaruffi.com/vol3/tippett.html"><span style='mso-ascii-font-family:
Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Keith Tippett</span></a>’s pseudo-jazz
orchestras. With these live performances, woodwind and keyboards took the
dominant role, which before were the drums and rhythm. The songs would stretch
and shake off of surreal trappings, and the injection of some seriousness into
the music foreshadowed the assimilation of certain techniques of the improvised
and avant-garde.<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<P>
<b>Facelift - France &amp; Holland</b> (2022) documents live performances of 1970.

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Third</b> (CBS, 1970)
is organized, such as the contemporary <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Ummagumma</b>
by Pink Floyd, into four long tracks, each taking up one side of the double
album. Ratledge’s signatures are <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Slightly
All The Time</i>, a nice jazz theme played with a mad gallop from gasping
keyboards and bloody sax progressions, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Out-Bloody-Rageous</i>,
a song inspired by minimalism and structured as a series of variations on a
theme. This track consists of an impeccable<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span>
driving change between keyboards and winds, a manifesto of cold rationality by
an electronic organist. Hopper’s contribution is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Facelift</i>, a theme that melts in clouds of orientalism. It is
enlivened by horn players’ interludes: in the first part a disjointed soprano
sax, alto sax<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> and trombone
are interjected in between sleepy mews. In the second part, a conjuror’s swing
flute raves through a lurking bass, and culminates with a jumble of alto sax at
the end. These three pieces keep the complexities of the earlier music created
by Soft Machine and add a technical leap. The organ of Ratledge is lively<span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span> and the music of Hendrix is
transformed into a cool jazz-rock. With this record, the drums no longer
experience fits of pataphysical madness, and an almost aesthetic use of the
wind section is utilized. A sense of maturity hangs over the professional
technique now displayed by the musicians on this record. The new sound
pioneered on <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Third </b>is rooted in two
major musicians of the avant-garde American era: Riley’s minimalism and the
jazz-rock of <a href="http://scaruffi.com/jazz/davis.html"><span
style='mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri'>Miles Davis</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wyatt is the composer and main performer (he plays all the
keyboards) of the beautiful <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Moon in June</i>,
one of the greatest masterpieces of English rock. This song reveals in Wyatt a
great composer and arranger as well as brilliant drummer and inimitable singer;
in short, he is a very complete musician. His inspiration is unlike Ratledge’s
modern influences. In his major composition there is little jazz, and in some
cases it is even less musically advanced. But<span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>,</span>
Wyatt is equipped with an imagination and a humanity that more than makes up
for any other deficiencies. The idea of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Moon
in June</i> is melodic and close to the soul. It is a mantra of undulating
psychedelia, but with a languid and resigned tone that suggests mantras and
songs undulating psychedelia, but with a languid tone and resigned that
suggests an anemic or dreamy chansonnier. The sudden changes of rhythm and
ecstatic crescendos of keyboards, faint whispers, and solemn spikes give the
music an almost epic tone, but also desperately sad. Here and there, there is a
resurgence of entertaining dada, exemplified by a soft humming nonsense and a
breakup of the pattern with an irregular rhythm. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Moon In June</i> is a free song that keyboards and drums strive to
follow in its magical musical evolution. The end comes after an excited
instrumental intermezzo through keyboard-noise, insistent bass lines, and
minimal notes of a piano on the last dying phonemes of a stentorian falsetto.
This long instrumental finale returns to the seductive grace of the early
pataphysicists, with a surreal and humorous tone that would always be the
fundamental tone of the music of Wyatt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With this record, Soft Machine built upon the history of
every genre of music to achieve that final peak. Upon filtering the music in
this record, to be found are traces of abused musical styles, but as with all
great works, everything is broken down into a personal vision of art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_GoBack"></a>Elton Dean, who with this record
became a permanent member, greatly influenced the style of the Soft Machine.
All tracks, except perhaps Wyatt’s, are inspired more by jazz than any of the
previous albums. Following this record, Ratledge took the lead completely, in
part due to Wyatt’s exhaustion. The drummer was about to leave the Soft Machine.

<P>
The seven-movement <b>Spaced</b> (Cuneiform, 1996) was composed as the
soundtrack to a 1969 multi-media event.
Ratledge, Hopper and Wyatt (and guesting saxophonist Brian Hopper)
re-designed and re-arranged music from the third album using tape loops
and other studio devices. 
The less ambitious pieces (such as <i>Spaced Two</i>) are merely
"remixes" of Soft Machine jams, but 
the music gets as abstract as musique concrete in
the watery vibrations of <i>Spaced One</i>, devastated after seven minutes by an excoriating distortion,
and especially in the 32-minute of <i>Spaced Four</i>, a colossal fresco
of disjointed instrumental sounds bordering on pure cacophony
but slowly revealing the perfectly organic jam from which it originated.
More mayhem follows, but this time driven by frenzied drums, until it is
again obliterated by electronic noise.
Few albums of 1969 dared this much.
<P>
<b>Noisette</b> (Cuneiform, 2000) documents a 1970 performance by
Ratledge, Hopper, Wyatt, Dean and temporary fifth member Lyn Dobson
(soprano saxophone and flute) and includes a 12-minute version of Ratledge's
<i>Eamonn Andrews</i>, a 14-minute version of <i>Esther's Nose Job</i> and an eleven-minute version of Hopper's <i>12/8 Theme</i> that rank among the
slickest jazz-rock jams of the era.

<A NAME=fou></A>
<P>
Soft Machine's <b>Fourth</b> (1971) was their first fully instrumental album.
Collaborators included Mark Charig (cornet), Roy
Babbington (double bass), Nick Evans (trombone), Jimmy Hastings (flute and clarinet), Alan Skidmore (tenor sax).
Wyatt's contribution to the compositions was minimal.
Needless to say, the jazz-rock elements were even stronger than on the third
album.
Ratledge's nine-minute <i>Teeth</i> displayed the dense, flawless amalgam of the
instruments, that blended the jubilant reeds, 
Ratledge's alienated keyboards, Hopper's singing bass and
Wyatt's unusually frantic and noisy drumming,
and then launched into a shimmering melodic theme.
The centerpiece is Hopper's four-movement suite <i>Virtually</i>: a
subdued trombone-heavy first part, a vibrant Dean-driven second part,
a dissonant free-form third part and a brief abstract keyboards-dominated fourth part.
<A NAME=fif></A>
<P>
Wyatt, last remaining of the founding members, left
to form <A HREF=../vol3/wyatt.html>Matching Mole</A>
and was replaced by Nucleau' drummer, John Marshall.
Thus Soft Machine's line-up for 
<b>5</b> (CBS, 1972) was a quartet with
Ratledge on keyboards, Hopper on bass, Dean on reeds and (mostly)
Marshall on drums.
The compositions are mostly by Ratledge e di Dean.
They reflect the fact that the psychedelic masters had left one by one,
and their place had been taken by practitioners of jazz-rock.
Ratledge's <i>All White</i> is the younger brother of the previous album's <i>Teeth</i>: a sprightly theme sustained by playful interplay.
The atmospheric music of the <b>Third</b> album is, instead, evoked in
Ratledge's <i>Drop</i>, divided between an overture of
swirling oneiric keyboards notes upset by dripping electronic sounds
and a vibrant alto-sax improvisation over a swinging rhythm section.
Textures become even more important in the longer <i>As If</i>, still
dominated for four minutes by Dean and then for four minutes by the
cello-sounding bass, and lacking a precise leitmotiv.
Dean's closing <i>Bone</i> would be the most experimental (or, at least,
unreal) track, but it lasts only three minutes.
As a conventional jazz-rock outfit, Soft Machine was far less engaging than
as a progressive-rock project, but still maintained a high degree of
musicianship.
<P>
In 1972 Dean too left, making way for keyboardist Karl Jenkins (ex-Nucleus), so that the <b>Sixth Album</b>, (CBS, 1972) is largely a work by Ratledge, although Hopper crafts the best music. The album is double, half live (Gesolreut, 37 1/2) and half studio (The Soft Weed Factor by Jenkins, Chloe And The Pirates by Ratledge, 1983 by Hopper). Ratledge, Hopper, Jenkins, and Marshall alternate between many instruments, in search of "the" transcendental timbre. The style has now escaped from jazz-rock: assimilating a little electronic avant-garde, it has turned into a virtuoso exercise in cold aestheticism. Hugh Hopper, however, has his first solo album ready and leaves Soft Machine.
<P>
It is no coincidence that on <b>Seven</b> (CBS, 1973), with the arrival of Roy Babbington on bass, the ensemble comes to include three ex-Nucleus members. <b>Bundles</b> (Harvest, 1975), with the addition of guitarist Allan Holdsworth, contains if nothing else the five-part suite <i>Hazard Profile</i>, but the sound is no longer even related to the old Soft Machine.

<A NAME=sof></A>
<P>
In 1976 even Ratledge left Soft Machine. The line-up of
Jenkins, Babbington, Marshall, guitarist John Etheridge and
saxophonist Alan Wakeman that plays on 
<b>Softs</b> (Harvest, 1976) did not feature any of the original members.
Jenkins leads the band through the austere scores of the
seven-minute <i>The Tale Of Taliesin</i> and the
nine-minute <i>Ban-Ban Caliban</i>.
<P>
Jenkins, Etheridge, Babbington, Marshall and keyboardist Carol Barratt released
<b>Rubber Riff</b> (Music DeWolfe, 1978 - Voiceprint, 1995), that was not
originally credited to the Soft Machine. Unusually for Soft Machine, it contains
14 brief compositions.
<P>
Jenkins and Marshall are the only full-time members on
<b>Land of Cockayne</b> (EMI, 1981), which employs a revolving cast of friends
(Allan Holdsworth, Jack Bruce, Dick Morrissey, etc).
Jenkins signs all the pieces and his keyboards "are" the sound of the longer
ones (<i>Over 'n' Above</i>, <i>Panoramania</i>, <i>Hot-Biscuit Slim</i>).
<P>
<b>Triple Echo</b> (Harvest, 1977) is a three-album box-set anthology.
Several live albums (and especially rare ones from the early period) came out
during the 1970s.
<P>
<b>BBC Radio</b> (HUx, 2003) is a terrible collection of  rarities from the early days.
<P>
<b>Out Bloody Rageous</b> is a double-CD career retrospective.
<P>
